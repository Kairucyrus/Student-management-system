# Student-management-system
A simple Program for students management using tkinter for UI and a number of python modules for basic operations.
Note the use of openpyxl for the operations on the sheet for students details.
Pillow's Image and ImageTk are used for the resizing of the images, as PhotoImage does not provide resizing operations.
Initial window size set to non-reducable.
